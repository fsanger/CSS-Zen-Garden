Classic CSS web redesign project

The classic website redesign project which pushes CSS skills. This ongoing online project restricts any changes to the HTML file allowing changes only to the CSS file, pushing the limits on the range of possibilities using CSS styling. This project proposed redesigning the site in the style of a specific period of design or art history: in this case, Postmodernism.
